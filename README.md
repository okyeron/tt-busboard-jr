# TT-Busboard-Jr.

a small powered i2c busboard for the monome/teletype i2c ecosystem

This is compact powered i2c busboard suitable for use with Teletype, Trilogy and other i2c modules. 

It provides 3 i2c / ii headers and additional pull-up to support larger i2c / ii networks.

You can connect up to 6 modules with regular (1x3) i2c jumpers or use a "flying bus" cable to connect multiple modules in series.

This busboard is designed to just hang out in the back of your rack - rather than be directly attached to a module.
